<p>
	Eloud is a lightweight screen reader for the Emacs text editor. Eloud works on Linux and OSX versions of Emacs and uses the espeak speech synthesizer as the backend. It's designed to respond to user input, so if you move a word, character, or sentence, Eloud will read that segment as you move. Eloud is based on my own scripts and infrastructure for coding and writing using Emacs.
