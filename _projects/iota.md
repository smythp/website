<p>
Iota School is a business, a curriculum, and a platform organized around accessible technical training. Curriculum is designed in small units, “iotas,” that can be organized and reorganized into sequences, whether for a one-hour demonstration, a two-hour workshop, a day-long intensive, a week-long institute, a months-long course, or a years-long self-inquiry.
