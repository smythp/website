<p>
	Foundations for Research Computing is a campus-wide initiative to build community and technical skills around research computing at Columbia. I served as Program Coordinator for Foundations from January 2019 to August 2022, and in that time organized training for more than 3,000 researchers over 85+ workshops, intensives, and lectures.

During my time with Foundations, I proposed and implemented new programming, including a popular <a href="https://rcfoundations.research.columbia.edu/content/python-user-group">Python User Group</a> and a <a href="https://rcfoundations.research.columbia.edu/content/foundations-curriculum-innovation-grant-program">Curriculum Innovation Grant</a> program. I also had the pleasure of working closely with a community of instructors trained by <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.
