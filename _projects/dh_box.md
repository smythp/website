<p>
In 2014, DH Box was envisioned as a pedagogical tool for DH-inflected classrooms and workshops, a "digital humanities laboratory in the cloud" that would give students the opportunity to engage with research questions without installing, configuring, and troubleshooting a digital working environment. With a startup grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a small team at the Graduate Center including project creator Stephen Zweibel and myself created a prototype web application using then-novel technologies such as Docker.

DH Box was used to teach technical workshops and courses at CUNY, the British Library, and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute. In 2018, with the development of well-resourced cloud offerings from companies and organizations such as Project Jupyter and Google, the DH Box team chose to retire the project.
