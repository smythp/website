<p>The <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> is an independent federal agency that supports humanities projects and initiatives, including those for education, historical preservation, and public-facing scholarship. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/16/520379061/read-president-trumps-budget-blueprint"> 


In 2017, the Trump administration proposed to eliminate funding to the NEH, an extreme stance that disregarded the local impact of the agency and its role in preserving and advancing American culture and scholarship.</p>

<p>In 2017, I created the NEH Impact Index to make visible the impact of the NEH on local communities and cultural institutions. <a href="/index"> The web app takes a zip code and search radius</a> and finds projects funded by the NEH in that region. Projects are color-coded by category to show their impact in areas such as education, preservation, and public programs.</p>

<p>The NEH Impact Index was created as part of a larger effort by <a href="https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI)</a> to highlight the impact of the NEH, not only in the humanities but also in the wider culture.
