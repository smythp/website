<p>
In 2022-2023, Space Telescope Science Institute will take steps to make scientific outputs, and especially Jupyter notebooks, more accessible for people with disabilities. STScI intends to accomplish this objective by implementing accessibility enhancements to published outputs of Jupyter notebooks used at STScI, contributing these improvements upstream to Project Jupyter where possible, and organizing educational events and workshops to raise awareness of accessibility in STEM. STScI will also directly involve affected communities by working in public and collaborating with community members through discussion and accessibility testing.
